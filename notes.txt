--JAL and JALR instruction implementation--
Need to write pc+4 to rd, will implement via a CPY on the ALU and decoder
swtiching into a +4 writeback path to the register bank
Version of ALU output unaltered by +4 goes back to PC

--ALU--
first input can be swtiched between current pc and register 1 output
second input can be swtiched between decoded immediate and register 2 output
